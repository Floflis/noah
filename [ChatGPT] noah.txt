"Please explain me this script:

"noah.sh":
#find . ! -name 'file.txt' -type f -exec rm -f {} +
#find . ! -name "CinnVIIStarkMenu@NikoKrause" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +"

This is a Bash script that uses the find command to delete all files and directories in the current directory, except for a file named file.txt and a directory named CinnVIIStarkMenu@NikoKrause.

The find command is a powerful tool for searching for files and directories in a specified directory and performing an action on them. In this script, the find command is used to locate all files and directories that should be deleted.

The ! -name option is used to exclude specific files and directories from the search. In this case, the file.txt file is excluded from the file search, and the CinnVIIStarkMenu@NikoKrause directory is excluded from the directory search.

The -type option is used to limit the search to only files (-type f) or only directories (-type d).

The -exec option is used to execute a command on each file or directory that is found. In this case, the rm command is used to delete the files (-f forces deletion without prompting for confirmation) and directories (-r recursively deletes directories and their contents).

The {} + at the end of the find command is used to signal the end of the command to be executed by -exec. It tells find to execute the command on as many files or directories as possible at once, which can be more efficient than running the command on each file or directory individually.

"Please rewrite this script in a way to add fixes and improvements.

Also, this script should support reading a file/folder list from an external file or variable array.

Do you think the biblical "noah" name makes sense for the purpose of this script?"

Without additional context, it's hard to say whether the name "noah" makes sense for this script. However, I can help you improve the script and add support for reading a file/folder list from an external file or variable array.

Here's an updated version of the script:
#!/bin/bash

# Define the list of files/folders to keep
keep_files=("file.txt" "CinnVIIStarkMenu@NikoKrause")

# Check if an external file is provided and read its contents into an array
if [ -f "$1" ]; then
  readarray -t keep_files < "$1"
fi

# Loop through all files/folders in the current directory
for file in *; do
  # Check if the file/folder should be kept
  if [[ ! " ${keep_files[@]} " =~ " ${file} " ]]; then
    # If not, delete it
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
      rm -f "$file"
    elif [ -d "$file" ]; then
      rm -rf "$file"
    fi
  fi
done

Here's how the updated script works:
- The script starts by defining the list of files/folders to keep in the keep_files array.
- If an external file is provided as an argument, the script checks if it exists and reads its contents into the keep_files array using the readarray command.
- The script then loops through all files/folders in the current directory and checks if each file/folder should be kept. The if statement checks if the file/folder name is in the keep_files array using the bash regex =~ operator.
- If the file/folder should not be kept, the script checks whether it's a file or folder using the if statement and deletes it using the appropriate rm command.

This updated version of the script is more flexible and easier to maintain, as it allows you to define the list of files/folders to keep in an external file or a variable array. Additionally, it improves the safety of the script by explicitly checking whether a file is a directory before deleting it.

"Thank you!

In my safer implementation of noah, it will replace "rm" by the "rmv" that uses "trash" rather than "rm".

I thought you would be able to guess that, as this script removes everything but the exceptions, it remembers exactly how God did to Noah and his family, by somewhat doing "rm" in everyone except the Noah & family."

I see! That makes sense. Thank you for clarifying.

"Why that makes sense (testing)?"

Testing is an essential part of software development because it helps ensure that the software meets the requirements and works as expected. By testing the software, developers can find and fix bugs, identify performance issues, and ensure that the software is secure and reliable.

Testing can be done at different levels, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. Each level of testing has its own goals and methods, and they all work together to ensure that the software is of high quality.

In addition, testing helps to identify areas for improvement and can guide future development efforts. It can also provide valuable feedback to stakeholders, such as users, management, and investors.

Therefore, testing is a critical aspect of software development and should be an integral part of the development process.

"You lost context too early.

Why the noah naming in the script makes sense?"

Oh, I see what you're asking now! I apologize for the confusion earlier.

The name "noah" in the script may be a reference to the biblical story of Noah's Ark. In the story, God commands Noah to build an ark and take two of every kind of animal on board to protect them from a catastrophic flood that will destroy the world.

Similarly, the script removes all files and directories except for the specified exceptions, much like how the flood destroyed everything except for what was on the ark. The name "noah" may have been chosen to evoke the idea of a selective preservation or protection of certain files, similar to how Noah was instructed to preserve certain animals.
